# Rails-Postgre-Docker-Alpine

# Build the project
  ```sh
docker-compose run web rails new . --force --no-deps --database=postgresql
  ```
# Connect the database
Replace the contents of config/database.yml with the following:

  ```yaml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  host: db
  username: postgres
  password: password
  pool: 5

development:
  <<: *default
  database: myapp_development


test:
  <<: *default
  database: myapp_test

```
You can now boot the app with docker-compose up:

docker-compose up
If allâ€™s well, you should see some PostgreSQL output.
  ```yaml
rails_db_1 is up-to-date
Creating rails_web_1 ... done
Attaching to rails_db_1, rails_web_1
db_1   | PostgreSQL init process complete; ready for start up.
db_1   |
db_1   | 2018-03-21 20:18:37.437 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on IPv4 address "0.0.0.0", port 5432
db_1   | 2018-03-21 20:18:37.437 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on IPv6 address "::", port 5432
db_1   | 2018-03-21 20:18:37.443 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on Unix socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"
db_1   | 2018-03-21 20:18:37.726 UTC [55] LOG:  database system was shut down at 2018-03-21 20:18:37 UTC
db_1   | 2018-03-21 20:18:37.772 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
  ```
Finally, you need to create the database. In another terminal, run:
  ```sh
docker-compose run web rake db:create
  ```
Here is an example of the output from that command:
  ```yaml
vmb at snapair in ~/sandbox/rails
$ docker-compose run web rake db:create
Starting rails_db_1 ... done
Created database 'myapp_development'
Created database 'myapp_test'
  ```
